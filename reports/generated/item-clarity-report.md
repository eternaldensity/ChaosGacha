# Item Gacha — Stage 3: Clarity / Confusion Report

Branch: `cleanup/skill-gacha` · File: `gachafiles/item.txt` (850 entries)
Scope: entries needing human input. Typos (stage 1) and conciseness (stage 2)
are done and not repeated here.

Structural notes (fixed in stage 1, confirm): duplicate ID blocks resolved
— second 670–689 block is now 829–849, Costume Wardrobe fills 666, and the
headerless Erdtree Seed entry is now 850. Open: "Hota" vs "HOTA" (file uses
Hota ~30×; one rewrite batch briefly used HOTA and was reverted — confirm
which is canonical).

Severity: **Blocker** = cannot implement/balance, infinite exploit, consent
violation, or game-breaking. **Major** = undefined mechanics/quantities or
heavy outside-knowledge dependence. **Minor** = moderation/tone/small
vagueness.

Doc reference: `Cooldown` = delay between active uses (reducible);
`Restock Timer` = delay until another copy can be taken. Many entries misuse
one for the other — the single biggest systemic fix below.

## Recommended human actions (minimal set)

1. Cooldown-vs-Restock audit: relabel every entry per Doc definitions;
   close Star<>Sun and Node loops; rule restock-stockpiling globally
   (consumed-on-use + stored cap).
2. Consent pass: slavery/mind-control/love/favor/forgiveness/summon-
   contract/greed/soul-taxes/census/slave-waiver/phone/slaughterhouse/
   morgue/NSFW-gear clusters (toggleable, resistible, consensual-only
   defaults; ban list).
3. Caps pass: all §Blockers numbers (areas, ranks, durations, costs,
   charges, quantities, cooldowns) + infinite economies (bars/purses/
   coins/ore/dust/cookies/souls/corpses/dust-mines/gold-tickets).
4. Keys/implants/tickets global rules (3 systemics) + per-key exceptions.
5. Inline the 33 URLs (snapshot spell lists) + unify teach-vs-cast;
   fix 290's tag; confirm Hota-vs-HOTA spelling.
6. Ticket-implant surgery rule; Teigu compatibility mechanic; Zanpakuto
   authorship; Devil Fruit water/ sheet definitions.
